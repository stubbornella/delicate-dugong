Please build out the following mini-mockup (a small snippet of a much larger page) in the png attached. The result should:
* Work in IE6+ and the latest version of all other major browsers
* Use CSS3 whenever possible and degrade nicely for browsers that do not support advanced features
* Take into account accessibility, performance, and maintainability
